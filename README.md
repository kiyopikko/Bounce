Bounce App

React.js, flux, Node/Express, mongodb
socket.io 

deployed through openshift.

npm install to set up.

run localy on localhost:8080

or go to mantis-ranson.rhcloud.com for a running Openshift app

This project is an ongoing party app I have put together in my spare time
for the past 4 months.

Issues I have ran into so far are.

Running cluster with socket.io.

Peace
